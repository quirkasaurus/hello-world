a seasoned witch could call you from the depths of your disgrace
and rearrange your liver to the solid mental grace
and achieve it all with music that came quickly from afar
then taste the fruit of man recorded losing all against the hour

and assessing points to nowhere leading every single one
a dewdrop can exalt us like the music of the sun
then take away the plane in which you move
and choose the course you're running

down at the end, round by the corner
not right away, not right away
close to the edge, just by a river
not right away, not right away

crossed a line around the changes of the summer
reaching out to call the color of the sky
passed around a moment clothed in mornings
faster than we see

getting over all the time i had to worry
leaving all the changes far from far behind
we relieve the tension only to find out the master's name

down at the end, round by the corner
close to the edge, just by a river
seasons will pass you by
i get up, i get down
now that's all over and done
now that you find,
now that you're whole

my eyes convinced eclipsed with the sudden moon attained with love
it changes almost strained amidst clear manna from above
i crucified my hate and held the word within my hand
there's you, the time, the logic, or the reasons we don't understand

close at the end, round by the corner,
down at the edge, round by a river

down at the edge, round by the river,
close to the end, down at the corner

sudden call shouldn't take away the startled memory
all in all the journey takes you all the way
as apart from any reality that you've ever seen and known

guessing problems only to deceive the mention
passing paths that cross halfway into the void
as we cross from side to side
we hear the total mass retain

down at the end, round by the corner
close to the end, down by a river
seasons will pass you by
i get up, i get down
